# Routing Protocols Simulation

This project simulates two fundamental routing algorithms used in computer networks:
Distance Vector Routing (DVR) and Link State Routing (LSR). It uses an adjacency matrix input
and outputs the routing tables generated by each algorithm.

## 1. Requirements

- Linux or Windows environment with a C++ compiler
- C++17 support (used features like `vector`, `ifstream`, etc.)

## 2. Building the Project

To compile the project:

```bash
make
```

## 3. Running the Implementation

Use the following command:

```bash
./routing_sim <input_file>
```

Where `<input_file>` contains the adjacency matrix representing the network graph. The first
value in the file is the number of nodes `n`, followed by `n x n` integers.

## 4. Assignment Features Implemented

- Distance Vector Routing using Bellman-Ford-style updates
- Link State Routing using Dijkstra's algorithm
- Routing table output for each node
- Destination node, the computed metric, and the next hop node
- Convergence detection in DVR (alg completes execution only on convergence)
- Unreachable links handled via `9999`

## 5. Design Decisions

### DVR Implementation

- Bellman-Ford-inspired updates across all nodes until no change occurs
- Each node considers all neighbors as intermediate hops
- Tracks and updates next hop whenever cost improves

### LSR Implementation

- Dijkstra's algorithm implemented with a visited array (not a priority queue)
- Computes shortest paths from each node
- Uses predecessor tracking to determine next hop

### Input Parsing

- Matrix read from text file using standard `ifstream`
- File format: first number is node count, followed by adjacency matrix entries

### Output

- Tables printed per node for both algorithms
- Each table includes destination, cost, and next hop
- Clear separation of simulation phases for DVR and LSR

## 6. Implementation

### `simulateDVR(const vector<vector<int>>& graph)`

- Initializes distance and next hop matrices
- Iteratively updates routing table using neighbor costs
- Converges when no distances are updated in a full iteration
- Prints final routing tables

### `simulateLSR(const vector<vector<int>>& graph)`

- Runs Dijkstra's algorithm from each node
- Computes distance and previous node arrays
- Traces back from each node to determine correct next hop
- Outputs final routing table for each source

### `printDVRTable`

- Prints the routing table for a given node after DVR converges

### `printLSRTable`

- Prints shortest paths from a node, including next hops calculated via predecessors

### `readGraphFromFile`

- Parses file containing adjacency matrix into a graph
- Exits with an error if the file is not found or formatted incorrectly

### `main()`

- Validates arguments and loads graph from file
- Runs DVR simulation
- Runs LSR simulation

## 7. Testing

### Correctness Testing

- Verified with small graphs with known shortest paths
- Compared outputs to manual calculations
- Tested with graphs including unreachable links

### Edge Case Testing

- Self-loops (0-cost handled correctly)
- Disconnected nodes (9999 cost retained)
- Symmetric and asymmetric cost matrices

## 8. Restrictions

- Only supports graphs from properly formatted input files
- Does not use optimized data structures (e.g., priority queue in Dijkstra)
- DVR convergence speed may degrade for large graphs

## 9. Challenges

### DVR Next Hop Logic

- Ensuring next hop updates consistently when a shorter path is found

### LSR Path Reconstruction

- Reconstructing next hop by tracing back via predecessor array
- Handled unreachable and self-loop cases explicitly

### Input File Handling

- Managing file read errors gracefully and validating input format
