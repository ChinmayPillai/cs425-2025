# Routing Protocols Assignment

## Features Implemented
- Distance Vector Routing (DVR) algorithm with iteration-by-iteration output
- Link State Routing (LSR) algorithm using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
- Input parsing from adjacency matrix files
- Proper handling of special values (0 for no self-cost, 9999 for unreachable links)
- Complete routing table generation showing destination, cost, and next hop
- DVR convergence detection (termination when no further updates occur)

## Design Decisions

### DVR Algorithm Implementation
- We chose to implement the Bellman-Ford approach for the Distance Vector Routing algorithm, which iteratively updates routing tables until convergence.
- We decided to print DVR tables after each iteration to visualize the convergence process, which helps in understanding how the algorithm works.
- For handling unreachable nodes, we maintain the special value (9999) rather than traditional infinity to be consistent with the input format.

### LSR Algorithm Implementation
- We implemented Dijkstra's algorithm for Link State Routing with a straightforward approach using visited array rather than a priority queue.
- This decision was made for clarity and readability, though a priority queue implementation would have been more efficient for larger networks.
- We trace back through the predecessor array to determine the next hop for each destination, ensuring the routing tables show the correct path information.

### Code Structure
- We maintained the existing function structure to keep the code organized and clear.
- We added detailed comments to explain the algorithm steps and complex operations.
- We included error handling for file operations to ensure robustness.

## Implementation

### High-Level Function Overview

#### `simulateDVR(const vector<vector<int>>& graph)`
- Initializes distance and next hop matrices based on the input graph
- Iteratively updates routing tables using the Bellman-Ford algorithm principle
- Continues updates until no changes occur (convergence)
- Outputs routing tables after each iteration and the final state

#### `simulateLSR(const vector<vector<int>>& graph)`
- For each node as source, computes shortest paths to all other nodes
- Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find optimal routes
- Tracks previous nodes to determine the path
- Outputs the final routing table for each node

#### `printDVRTable` and `printLSRTable`
- Format and display routing tables according to assignment specifications
- Handle special cases like self-routes and unreachable destinations

#### `readGraphFromFile`
- Parses the input file to construct the adjacency matrix
- Handles potential file access errors

### Code Flow

1. **Program Initialization**:
   - Parse command-line arguments
   - Read and construct the network graph from the input file

2. **DVR Simulation**:
   - Initialize routing tables with direct connections
   - Iteratively update tables based on information from neighbors
   - Print tables after each iteration
   - Terminate when no further updates occur

3. **LSR Simulation**:
   - For each node as source:
     - Run Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest paths
     - Compute next hop information
     - Print the resulting routing table

4. **Program Termination**:
   - Clean up resources
   - Exit

## Testing

### Correctness Testing
- We verified correctness using the example input provided in the assignment description.
- We manually traced through the algorithms to ensure the routing tables matched expected outputs.
- We tested edge cases including:
  - Networks with unreachable nodes (9999 cost links)
  - Networks with varying sizes (small and medium-sized)

### Test Cases
- We created simple test networks with known shortest paths to verify algorithm correctness.
- We tested with symmetric and asymmetric cost matrices to ensure the algorithms handle directional links properly.
- We performed manual verification of next hop calculations to ensure routing tables were accurate.

## Restrictions
- The implementation assumes that the input graph follows the format specified in the assignment.
- The DVR algorithm might take longer to converge for larger networks or networks with specific topologies.
- The LSR implementation has O(nÂ²) time complexity, which could be improved with a priority queue for larger networks.

## Challenges

### Algorithm Understanding
- Initially, we faced challenges in understanding how to properly update the next hop information in the DVR algorithm.
- We solved this by carefully studying the relationship between the distance matrix and next hop matrix, ensuring that when a path is updated, the next hop is updated accordingly.

### Convergence Detection
- Detecting when the DVR algorithm has converged was challenging as it required tracking whether any updates occurred in an iteration.
- We implemented a boolean flag to track updates and break the loop when no updates occur.

### Next Hop Calculation in LSR
- Computing the correct next hop for the LSR algorithm was difficult as it required tracing back through the predecessor array.
- We implemented a loop that traverses the predecessor array until finding a node directly connected to the source.
